ptklocate - perl-tk interface to locate(1)
Scott Doty, C<< <vallor at cultnix.org > >>

This perl script uses perl-tk to provide a graphical interface to locate(1).

Since this is using perl-tk, standard xrdb application default files can be
used to configure font, color, etc.  It will look for the xrdb file
'.ptklocaterc' in the local directory, and in your home directory.  You
should have gotten this with a file, Ptklocate.ad, which might be an
appropriate jumping-off place.

And as with pretty much any perl-tk script, you can start the application
with resource options, such as: ptklocate -font 'Courier 14'

locate(1) has a lot more options that could be encorporated in the script. 
Perhaps next version.

This is my first "application" written with perl-tk -- I hope you enjoy it.
